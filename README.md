Overview:

This project is a Chrome Dino game clone designed to run on the TTGO ESP32 with an SSD1306 screen. It utilizes the TFT_eSPI library to render graphics and animate the game. The project includes sprite handling for the dinosaur, obstacles, and game elements.

Features:

Dinosaur Animation: Multiple frames for realistic movement.

Obstacle Generation: Random obstacles appear on the screen.

Game Over Detection: Collision detection to end the game when the dinosaur hits an obstacle.

Optimized Graphics: Utilizes TFT_eSPI for efficient rendering.

Hardware Requirements:

TTGO ESP32

Micro USB C Cable

Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE

TFT_eSPI Library

ESP32 Board Support (LilyGo T-Display)

Installation:

Install the necessary libraries in Arduino IDE.

Open the provided .h and .ino file and upload it to your TTGO ESP32.

Usage:

Power on the TTGO ESP32.

The game starts automatically.
